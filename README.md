1 - How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    An important aspect of an agile based project is the implementation of user feedback. Working    with the Product Owner to create user stories based on the needs of the user and the software    creates a functional product based on the most prioritized subjects. 

2 - How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 	 An analysis of the developing project is first done to understand the requirements of the       program. If agile methodologies are determined to be a good fit, which in many circumstances     at least some agile principles can be incorporated, then I would plan to use Scrum practices     such as Sprint Planning to determine the product backlog, Daily Scrum’s to establish a           culture of independence and accountability, Spring Review’s to deliver finished Sprint           results, and Sprint Retrospective’s for team growth.  
3 - What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development is associated with a good work ethic, a desire to learn, accountability, self-organization, willingness to help others, and leadership. Agile methodologies flow easier when all team members work together for an overall purpose.
